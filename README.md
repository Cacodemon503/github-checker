The program was compilated with pyinstaller, so it may be [false positive to your anitvirus](https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/issues/4633). 
If you are not shure, you can check the source code and use it instead of .exe file.

#### You may also use source script instead of app, in this case just use `git-checker.py`. 
Check the code for required modules
